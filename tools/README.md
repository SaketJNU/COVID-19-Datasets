## Tools

_to be updated shortly along with [project sterling](https://github.com/kalyaniuniversity/sterling)_

### Parser

> The `daily_json_parser.py` is used to parse [this](https://api.covid19india.org/states_daily.json) API response and get back results. This is used internally by us and shall be updated to cover a more wider variety of cases soon.

### Checker

> The `checker.py` tool is used internally by us to keep a check on data discrepancy. This requires a configuration file to run which contains our API keys. We do not intend to make our API keys public. If you wish to use this tool, [write to us](mailto:debabratacse2020@klyuniv.ac.in) so that we can share the API key with you.
